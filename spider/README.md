A spider program is a program that uses a crawler method to find all the web page links implicit in a web page.

This spider can be used by specifying a target_url and finding all the web page links that can be connected to the target site.

usage : 
ex) python spider.py

*********Careful when using the program**********
The user must specify the URL of the desired target.
target_url = {the URL you want to search for}
ex) "http://myhomepage.com/mutillidae/"
