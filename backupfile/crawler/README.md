A crawler program is a program used to automatically search a website by following links from one webpage to another.

You can use this crawler by specifying a target_url and determining the subdomain of the target site.

usage : 
ex) python crawler.py

*********Careful when using the program**********
The user must specify the URL of the desired target.
target_url = {the URL you want to search for}
ex) "google.com", "namver.com"

Also, the crawler.py file and the subdomains.txt file must be located in the same path for it to work.
