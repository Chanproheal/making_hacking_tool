A backdoor program attempts to gain remote access through the back door of the target computer.
usage : 
[ + ] -> attacker : listener.py
python listener.py
[ + ] -> victim : reverse_backdoor.py
python reverse_backdoor.py

Once connected, the program can upload or download files that the attacker has on the target computer.

These files are called listener.py and newlistener.py with a new, but you can use any of them.

The file is in python, so you'll need to have python installed, but you can make reverse_backdoor.py an exe or image file and distribute it if you know the attacker IP to connect to that part.
