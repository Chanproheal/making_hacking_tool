The vulnerability_scanner program is a program that uses a crawl of a target website to scan that site for vulnerabilities.

With this program, you can find out what vulnerabilities the website has and see what those vulnerabilities are.

This program is currently only capable of analyzing XSS vulnerabilities, but more will be added in the future.

usage :
ex) python vulnerability_scanner.py

*************************Cautions when using the program***********************
When using the program, there are some parts that need to be defined by the user.

target_url = {the URL you want to search for},
ex) "http://myhomepage.com/mutillidae/"

links_to_ignore = {the URL of the website you want to find logout.php},
ex) "http://myhomepage.com/dvwa/logout.php"

login_dict = {the username and password you have to access that website},
--> For login_dict, I need to format it as {input_name: the value I want to put in} from a dictionary because different websites may have different names for the value they pass as input in the form.
ex) "username":"admin","password":"password","Login":"submit"

vuln_scanner.session.post("http://192.168.111.154/dvwa/login.php",data=login_dict)
= {PHP of the login part of the website}
ex) "http://myhomepage.com/dvwa/login.php",data=login_dict

Note that the login and logout files don't necessarily have to be PHP, as they are just files that give commands to the server.

You will need to specify the above parts as your desired website.
