# making_hacking_tool
This project is about building a basic hacking attack tool using python.<br>
All code and all methods are based on the Learn Python & Ethical Hacking from Scratch hosted by zsecurity on udemy.<br>

This project has implemented mac_changer, network scanner ,arp spoofing, code, dns spoofing, code injector, malware, packet sniffer, replace download, vulnerability analysis scanner, crawler, etc and overall it has implemented the basic necessary parts.<br>

All URLs used in this project are from inside my virtual environment.<br>

To use the tools through this project, please refer to the README.md file inside each file.<br>

Here's how to use the tools<br>
<br>CLI-based<br>
git clone https://github.com/Chanproheal/making_hacking_tool<br>
If you are downloading a non-CLI based file, just download the file as is.<br>
After installing that file and before using the tool, run the requirements.txt file to install the basic modules used by the tool.<br>

=> Linux & Mac Os<br>
./requirements.txt<br>

=> window<br>
{your python file path}\python.exe -r requirements.txt<br>

If the module doesn't install during this process, you'll need to turn on cmd or terminal with administrator privileges.<br>

Please note that this project is not a perfect tool at this time, as it was created for educational purposes and not as a complete tool, and we are constantly updating it.<br>
