This project has implemented mac_changer, network scanner ,arp spoofing, code, dns spoofing, code injector, malware, packet sniffer, replace download, vulnerability analysis scanner, crawler, etc and overall it has implemented the basic necessary parts.

To use the tools through this project, please refer to the README.md file inside each file.

Here's how to use the tools
CLI-based
git clone https://github.com/Chanproheal/making_hacking_tool
If you are downloading a non-CLI based file, just download the file as is.

After installing that file and before using the tool, run the requirements.txt file to install the basic modules used by the tool.

=> Linux & Mac Os
./requirements.txt

=> window
{your python file path}\python.exe -r requirements.txt

If the module doesn't install during this process, you'll need to turn on cmd or terminal with administrator privileges.

Please note that this project is not a perfect tool at this time, as it was created for educational purposes and not as a complete tool, and we are constantly updating it.
